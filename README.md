# IoT-Based Environment Monitoring System

## Abstract
This project is an IoT-Based Environment Monitoring System using ESP32 and DHT22 sensor to monitor temperature and humidity. The data is uploaded to ThingSpeak cloud for real-time monitoring.

## Objectives
- Measure temperature and humidity
- Send sensor data to cloud
- Visualize data online using ThingSpeak

## Hardware Components
- ESP32 Development Board
- DHT22 Temperature and Humidity Sensor
- Breadboard
- Jumper Wires
- Micro USB Cable
- 5V/2A Mobile Charger

## Software Components
- Arduino IDE
- Arduino Programming Language
- ThingSpeak Cloud
- Web Browser
- Windows OS

## Working Principle
The DHT22 sensor measures temperature and humidity. ESP32 reads the values and sends them to ThingSpeak cloud using WiFi. The data is displayed as graphs.

## Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates real-time environment monitoring using IoT technology.
